# Kenya HIV Insight Project

## Overview

The Kenya HIV Insight Project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization platform designed to provide actionable insights into Kenya's HIV epidemic. This project leverages multiple data sources to present key epidemiological indicators, treatment outcomes, and demographic patterns related to HIV/AIDS in Kenya.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze HIV prevalence trends across different demographic groups and geographic regions
- Monitor treatment outcomes and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage
- Identify high-risk populations and geographic hotspots
- Support evidence-based decision making for HIV prevention and treatment programs
- Visualize complex epidemiological data for stakeholders and policymakers

## Data Sources

This analysis incorporates data from several authoritative sources:

- **Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA)** - National household survey data (2018-2019)
- **Kenya AIDS Indicator Surveys (KAIS)** - Historical trend data (2007, 2012)
- **District Health Information Software-2 (DHIS2)** - National health facility reporting system
- **National Data Warehouse (NDW)** - Electronic medical records from HIV care facilities
- **Kenya National AIDS Control Council (NACC)** - Strategic planning and policy documents
- **Ministry of Health (MOH)** - Official health statistics and surveillance data

## Key Features

### Data Analysis Components
- **Prevalence Analysis**: HIV prevalence by age, gender, county, and urban/rural classification
- **Treatment Cascade**: Analysis of the 90-90-90 targets (testing, treatment, viral suppression)
- **Geographic Mapping**: County-level and sub-county HIV indicators
- **Trend Analysis**: Longitudinal patterns over multiple survey periods
- **Risk Factor Assessment**: Behavioral and demographic risk factors
- **Program Performance**: ART coverage, retention rates, and treatment outcomes

### Visualization Capabilities
- Interactive dashboard with multiple visualization types
- Geographic heat maps for spatial analysis
- Time series charts for trend analysis
- Demographic breakdowns with cross-tabulations
- Treatment cascade waterfall charts
- Comparative analysis across different population groups

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with interactive components
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau (primary visualization engine)
- **Data Processing**: Python/R for statistical analysis
- **Database**: Structured data storage for processed datasets
- **Deployment**: Web-based application hosted on cloud infrastructure

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Extraction**: Raw data collection from multiple sources
2. **Data Cleaning**: Standardization, validation, and quality checks
3. **Data Integration**: Merging datasets with common identifiers
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculation of key indicators and confidence intervals
5. **Visualization Preparation**: Data formatting for Tableau integration
6. **Dashboard Deployment**: Publication of interactive visualizations

## Key Indicators Tracked

### Epidemiological Indicators
- HIV prevalence (overall and by subgroups)
- HIV incidence estimates
- New HIV infections
- AIDS-related mortality
- Mother-to-child transmission rates

### Treatment and Care Indicators
- Number of people living with HIV (PLHIV)
- ART coverage
- Viral load suppression rates
- Treatment retention rates
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake

### Testing and Prevention Indicators
- HIV testing coverage
- Knowledge of HIV status
- Condom use rates
- Medical male circumcision coverage
- Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) coverage

## Geographic Coverage

The analysis covers all 47 counties in Kenya with the following administrative levels:
- National level aggregates
- County-level analysis
- Sub-county breakdowns (where data availability permits)
- Urban vs. rural classifications
- Special focus on high-burden regions

## Target Audience

- **Policymakers**: Ministry of Health, NACC, county health departments
- **Program Implementers**: NGOs, healthcare facilities, community organizations
- **Researchers**: Academic institutions, research organizations
- **Development Partners**: USAID, CDC, WHO, UNAIDS, bilateral donors
- **Public Health Professionals**: Epidemiologists, public health practitioners

## Data Quality and Limitations

### Quality Assurance Measures
- Systematic data cleaning and validation procedures
- Cross-validation across multiple data sources
- Statistical weighting for population representativeness
- Confidence interval calculations for key estimates

### Known Limitations
- Survey data may have sampling biases
- Facility-based data may not capture all populations
- Some indicators have limited geographic granularity
- Time lags in data availability may affect currency of estimates

## Usage Guidelines

### For Analysts
- Review data dictionary before analysis
- Apply appropriate statistical weights when available
- Consider confidence intervals when interpreting results
- Cross-reference findings with multiple data sources

### For Visualization Users
- Interactive dashboards allow filtering by multiple dimensions
- Tableau visualizations provide drill-down capabilities
- Export functionality available for presentations and reports
- Mobile-responsive design for field use

## Data Updates and Maintenance

- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly updates when new data becomes available
- **Version Control**: All datasets are versioned with change logs
- **Quality Monitoring**: Regular data quality assessments
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Continuous improvement based on user input

## Collaboration and Partnerships

This project is developed in collaboration with:
- Kenya Ministry of Health
