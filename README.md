# 🦠 Kenya HIV Divide: Data-Driven Insights for Equitable Health Access

This project analyzes HIV treatment, burden, and mortality data across Kenya to uncover disparities in antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, access to care, and epidemiological hotspots. Built on robust data analysis and visualizations hosted on [Lovable](https://lovable.africa) (or your analysis platform), this initiative empowers stakeholders with actionable insights toward achieving the **UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets** by 2030.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Kenya has made progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but regional disparities in HIV burden, treatment access, and outcomes persist. Rural and underserved counties face challenges in reaching people living with HIV (PLHIV), initiating ART, and retaining patients in care.

Using detailed county-level data, this project:

- Maps ART distribution and HIV-related mortality
- Highlights vulnerable populations (youth, children, women)
- Tracks progress toward national and global HIV control targets
- Supports data-driven decision-making in health policy and program planning

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🗺️ Visualize HIV burden and ART access across all Kenyan counties
- 📍 Identify treatment deserts and underserved areas
- 📊 Assess ART coverage among children, adolescents, and adults
- ⚰️ Analyze HIV-related mortality by age group and region
- 🚸 Highlight gaps in pediatric and adolescent care
- 📈 Monitor progress toward 95-95-95 targets (diagnosis, treatment, viral suppression)
- 🧭 Inform strategic public health interventions and equitable resource distribution
